How to best graph this data?

I would like to see first whether pretest and posttest scores correlate in any way. Even better if they are grouped by grade. So this would be a scatter plot of posttest vs pretest scores, with different colors representing different grades.

Second, I'd like to see whether the TV show made any difference. This can be achieved by a grouped bar plot, showing 4 groups of bars - one for each grade. Each group of bars should contain one bar for the pretest score and one bar for the posttest score.

In order to have another metric on "success" it would be good to see the difference in scores the TV show produced. So, I would like a histogram of the difference in both scores. There can be two different histograms for the two groups (test / control) and one where the results are combined.

It would also be useful to see whether the city makes any difference, and whether or not the difference in cities is statistically significant.

Of course, these are just initial ideas. Findings from any of these would propose more questions and therefore more ways to look at the data.
