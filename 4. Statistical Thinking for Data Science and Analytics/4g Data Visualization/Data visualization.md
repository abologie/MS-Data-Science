## Data Visualization

Please describe which chart you would choose to visually illustrate each of the following comparisons:

* Which crime types are proportionally more common or less common in each of the boroughs?
	* Bar chart of the differences in individial crime rates from a mean value
* Whether murder rates from 2010-2014 across each borough are related to other crime rates in the same period? 
	* Small multiples of line charts (or scatterplots) showing two different crimes on each axis
* What are the challenges to plotting large ranges in data values (e.g. murder rates versus property crime rates) in one visualization?
	* The data might become unreadable or difficult to convey the message. Also, big variations in data might mask smaller variations
* What other data might be useful to further explore changes in these crime rates over time?
	* More background on the criminals - age, gender; more details on the location, and / or samples from more locations
